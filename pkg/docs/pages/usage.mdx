# Usage

## Templates

Almost all strings (`vars`, `env`, `cmd`, `args`) are parsed by [Go's template engine](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/) before execution or application. Variables are accessible via the dot syntax (`{{.VAR}}`).

There are more functions supported via the [slim-spring](https://go-task.github.io/slim-sprig/) package.
